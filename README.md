### Project Overview
Heart data analysis involves the examination and interpretation of data related to heart health and cardiovascular conditions. This field encompasses various aspects, including medical research, clinical studies, and health monitoring.Heart data analysis often involves monitoring physiological parameters related to heart health, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. It helps in assessing an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. This risk assessment can guide healthcare professionals in creating personalized prevention and intervention strategies.

### Data Cleaning
In the data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks;

1. Data loading
2. Data Validation
3. Data cleaning
4. Handling Missing Values

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Patient Heart Data to answer key questions such as;

 - Generate a categorical variable with age.
 - Exploratory analysis of the data.
 - Reviewing the numerical variables ,and scale variables if necessary
 - Are there variables have some degree of symmetry? Apply some transformation to have a more symmmetric variable?
 - Are there categorical variables in the dataset?pass them to numbers?
 
### Insights
1.Asymptomatic angina (chest pain) was more prevalent across all age categories, with fewer instances of typical angina.

2.Individuals with high blood pressure tended to experience typical angina.

3.Males exhibited a higher frequency of angina than females, potentially influenced by dataset gender imbalances.

4.Most males experienced asymptomatic angina.

5.On Average heart rate was slightly higher in females than males.

6.Over the years, females showed an increase in both average blood pressure and cholesterol levels compared to males.

7.There was a positive relationship between cholesterol values and resting blood pressure, indicating that as cholesterol values increased, resting blood pressure tended to increase as well.
